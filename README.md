# Application Structure

## Node Backend/API Layer

- Handles domain logic
- Handle database queries
- Implement pagination logic (e.g., limit, offset)
- Process search/filter requests
- Calculate total items and total pages
- Return structured data (e.g., including pagination metadata)

## Service Layer

`services/[domain]/` (e.g., services/equipment)

- Abstract API calls
- Construct API endpoints (e.g., with query parameters)
- Handle data transformation
- Manage API error scenarios

## Pages

`pages/[menu item]` (e.g., pages/Production)

- Manages UI state (table data, popups, form data)
- Handles routing using React Router, passing state via navigation rather than URL parameters
- Pagination metadata (e.g., total items, total pages)
- Orchestrate data fetching, On component mount, On page change, On search term change
- Handle React re-rendering

## Common Components

`components/[common component category]/` (e.g., components/common)

- Present data (e.g., tabular format)
- Render pagination controls
- Provide search input field
- Handle row-level actions (e.g., edit, delete)


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
